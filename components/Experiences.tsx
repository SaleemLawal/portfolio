          I'm an incoming Software Engineer at Bloomberg and a recent UMBC
          graduate with a B.Sc. in Computer Science. I specialize in backend
          development and system design, focusing on building high-performance,
          scalable, and security-driven solutions. My experience spans financial
          systems, AI-driven applications, cloud infrastructure, and
          cybersecurity. I enjoy optimizing systems, diving into distributed
          computing, and solving complex problems that drive real-world impact.

          Outside of coding, I'm passionate about football, weightlifting, and
          exploring emerging technologies. I enjoy reading self-improvement and
          finance books, with a strong interest in quant finance, algorithmic
          trading, and long-term investing. I believe in continuous
          growthâ€”whether it's sharpening my technical skills, strengthening my
          mindset, or embracing new challenges. I'm always looking for
          opportunities to build, innovate, and contribute to impactful
          projects.
